# Project Tasks Log

This document tracks all implementation tasks performed for the Creditcoin Testnet Faucet app.

## 2025-09-30

- Initialized Next.js (App Router) with TypeScript, ESLint, src directory, and absolute imports `@/*`.
- Installed `styled-components` and configured SSR support with a registry under `src/theme/styled-registry.tsx`.
- Added theme system in `src/theme/theme.ts` and type augmentation in `src/theme/styled.d.ts`.
- Implemented a glassmorphism faucet UI component at `src/components/FaucetCard.tsx`.
- Replaced default home with faucet card in `src/app/page.tsx`.
- Added Creditcoin Testnet constants and faucet cap in `src/constants/creditcoin.ts` using endpoints from Creditcoin Docs [Creditcoin Endpoints](https://docs.creditcoin.org/smart-contract-guides/creditcoin-endpoints) and [Testnet Environment](https://docs.creditcoin.org/environments/testnet).
- Created utilities for validation in `src/utils/validation.ts`.
- Implemented API route `POST /api/faucet` in `src/app/api/faucet/route.ts` using `ethers` to send CTC on Creditcoin Testnet via HTTPS RPC with a maximum request amount of 1000 CTC and a simple in-memory rate limit.

### UI Additions (Tailwind/shadcn structure)

- Installed Tailwind CSS (`tailwindcss`, `postcss`, `autoprefixer`) and configured `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, and `src/app/globals.css` with Tailwind directives.
- Added shadcn-style folders: `src/components/ui` and `src/lib/utils.ts` with `cn` helper using `clsx` + `tailwind-merge`.
- Added `src/components/ui/dithering-shader.tsx` WebGL background animation and `src/components/ui/swirl.tsx` sample component.
- Created demo route at `src/app/demo/swirl/page.tsx` rendering the shader as a background.

### Environment Variables

- `FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY`: Private key of the treasury/faucet wallet on Creditcoin Testnet.

### Setup Instructions

#### 1. Create `.env.local` file in project root:

```bash
# .env.local
FAUCET_PRIVATE_KEY=0xYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE
```

**IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:**
- ⚠️ Never commit `.env.local` to git (already in .gitignore)
- ⚠️ Use a dedicated wallet for the faucet
- ⚠️ Keep the private key secure
- ⚠️ Fund the wallet with sufficient CTC for distribution

#### 2. Get Creditcoin Testnet CTC:

- Network: Creditcoin Testnet
- RPC URL: `https://rpc.cc3-testnet.creditcoin.network`
- Chain ID: `102031`
- Symbol: `CTC`
- Explorer: `https://creditcoin-testnet.blockscout.com/`

#### 3. Run the application:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### 4. Test the faucet:

1. Open `http://localhost:3000`
2. Enter a valid EVM address (0x...)
3. Enter amount (max 1000 CTC)
4. Click "Request CTC"
5. Wait for transaction confirmation

### API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/faucet`

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "address": "0x...",
  "amount": 100
}
```

**Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "hash": "0x...",
  "explorer": "https://creditcoin-testnet.blockscout.com/tx/0x...",
  "status": 1
}
```

**Rate Limiting & Cooldown:**
- 5 requests per IP per minute (rate limiting)
- 1 hour cooldown per IP address
- 1 hour cooldown per wallet address
- Returns 429 with time remaining if cooldown active

### Features Already Implemented

✅ **Secure Transaction Handling**
- Ethers.js v6 for blockchain interactions
- Proper error handling and validation
- Transaction confirmation waiting

✅ **Rate Limiting & Cooldown**
- IP-based rate limiting (5 req/min)
- 1 hour cooldown per IP and wallet address
- Time remaining displayed to user
- In-memory tracking (can be upgraded to Redis for production)

✅ **Input Validation**
- EVM address format validation
- Amount clamping (0.000001 - 1000 CTC)
- Sanitized inputs

✅ **User Experience**
- Real-time transaction status
- Explorer link for verification
- Clear error messages

## Layout Improvements

- Fixed animated background to be full screen (`fixed inset-0` positioning at z-0).
- Centered the faucet card on the page with proper z-index layering (card wrapper at z-100).
- Removed redundant container wrapper from `FaucetCard.tsx` to simplify layout structure.
- Card now properly displays centered in front of the animated background.
- Used `position: fixed` for card wrapper with `pointerEvents` control for proper layering and interaction.
- Fixed white edge lines in corners by:
  - Adding `overflow: hidden` to background container
  - Setting background color `#0a1224` to match the shader's `colorBack`
  - Resetting all margins/padding to 0 in `globals.css` and `layout.tsx`
  - Ensuring canvas takes full width and height with proper styling

## UI/UX Design Enhancements

### Faucet Card Redesign
- **Enhanced Glassmorphism**: Upgraded card with stronger blur effects (24px), better saturation, and gradient background
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Added gradient text for title, animated network badge with pulsing indicator
- **Modern Inputs**: 
  - Redesigned input fields with hover and focus states
  - Added smooth transitions and glow effects
  - Improved placeholder styling
- **Button Enhancement**:
  - Gradient background (blue to purple)
  - Shimmer effect on hover
  - Lift animation with enhanced shadow
  - Proper alignment with input fields using flexbox
  - Full-width on mobile
- **Message Feedback**:
  - Redesigned error/success messages as styled message boxes
  - Added slide-in animation
  - Clean Unicode icons (× for error, ✓ for success)
- **Additional Features**:
  - Added divider with gradient for visual separation
  - Clickable explorer link with hover states
  - Animated pulsing network status indicator
  - Top gradient line accent on card
- **Language & Content**: All UI text in English for international accessibility
- **Typography**: Modern Inter font from Google Fonts with multiple weights (400-800), font smoothing enabled
- **Responsive Design**: Button and layout adapt gracefully to mobile screens
- **Alignment**: Button properly aligned with input field using grid layout with matching heights
- **Footer**: Added "Built by enliven" footer with link to GitHub profile (https://github.com/enliven17) and GitHub icon

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed "window is not defined" SSR error in `AnimatedBackground.tsx` by adding mounted state check and preventing window access during server-side rendering
- Adjusted background animation speed from 0.9 to 0.4 for a smoother, more subtle effect

## Loading State

- Added initial loading spinner (800ms) on page load to ensure smooth component rendering
- Modern spinner design matching app theme (blue gradient colors)
- Prevents layout shift and ensures all components mount properly before display

## Visual Polish

- Increased card background transparency (from 0.85/0.9 to 0.15/0.2 opacity) to reveal animated background
- Reduced blur from 24px to 12px for maximum animation visibility
- Enhanced border and shadow for better depth perception with transparent background
- Transaction success message now includes clickable "View on Explorer" link
- Fixed text overflow in transaction messages with proper word-wrapping
- Updated page title to "Creditcoin Testnet Faucet" (removed "Free CTC Tokens")
- Created custom Creditcoin-themed SVG favicon with blue color scheme
